# Beyond excel  
Excel is good for :
- browsing data
- quick visualisation
- non-programmers
- 1 user applications

Python is good for :
- cleaning data
- automating stuff
- simplify processes
- multiple users applications

Both of them can work in complementary ways. For example a Python script can fetch data on the internet, process it, clean it a create a CSV result visible on Excel.


# Data structures
Each programming language has its own way to handle data. Python uses Lists and Dicts.  
But a modern language must know how to play with the pillars of web data : JSON (for API), CSV (for tabular data), XML (for RSS feeds, HTML pages, structured elements...) and databases.  
With the appropriate tools, you can scrap, parse, analyse, graph data and so much more !

1. You will find nearly everything on Google
2. Most difficult part is choosing a language : Python. Done.
3. A programmer is someone who can turn Stack Overflow answers into running code
4. The most important part is when you try it yourself
5. Excel formulas can be much more complicated than actual code
6. If your code is too complicated, there must be another solution
6. If your Excel is too complicated, switch to code
